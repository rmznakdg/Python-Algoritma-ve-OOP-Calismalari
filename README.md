# Python Algorithms & OOP Studies 

This repository serves as a collection of my algorithmic solutions and object-oriented programming (OOP) practices developed during my Computer Engineering education.

## 🚀 Overview
The main goal of these studies is to strengthen data structure logic and implement clean code principles in Python.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
* **Concepts:** Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
* **Key File:** `Hayvanlar Sınıfı.ipynb` - Demonstrates class hierarchy and method overriding.

### 2. Algorithmic Solutions
* **Mathematics:** Prime numbers, Fibonacci series, Factorial calculations.
* **Logic:** Pisagor implementation and geometric calculations.
* **Tools:** Developed using both standard Python scripts (.py) and Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for data science workflows.

### 3. Mini Tools
* Interactive console applications involving user input validation and file handling operations.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
* **Python:** Intermediate level syntax and libraries.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive coding and documentation.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Solving mathematical problems with code logic.
